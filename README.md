# Ease Function Kit

This implementation provides a simple set of easing functions for various speed modifications in Unity. Easing functions are commonly used in animations to create smooth transitions and control the rate of change over time, allowing for effects like acceleration, deceleration, and oscillation. These native C# implementations are adapted from examples available on [Easings.net](https://easings.net/), a popular resource for visualizing and understanding easing curves. The functions are designed to work seamlessly with Unityâ€™s animation and movement systems, giving developers the ability to easily apply different types of motion, such as linear, quadratic, cubic, and elastic, to their game objects or UI elements. These easing functions are ideal for fine-tuning animations, transitions, and movement behaviors in games or interactive applications.
